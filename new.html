                    <h3>For when you feel unconfident:</h3>
                    <p>On the third, when I first asked you to be my girlfriend, I was very nervous.</p>
                    <p>When I first laid my eyes on you, I knew I would fall in love with you. You are the prettiest girl, and you have a heart of shining gold. You possess a trait that not a lot of people in this world have, and that is kindness.</p>
                    <p>You have boundless kindness to everyone you meet. You give people chances, and that is why I was so attracted to you in the first place. You were never shy to say your opinion, and your confidence shows in your beauty.</p>
                    <p>I think after meeting you, I started believing Aristotle. He was right: Beautiful people have beautiful hearts. I think I might just have found the most beautiful one of them all.</p>

                    <h3>For when you feel upset:</h3>
                    <p>I think one of the most beautiful things about you is your resillience. You are always willing to communicate and hash things out when things get rough. Even when we are both upset at each other, you always look out for my well-being, and it is somehting I am always grateful for.</p>
                    <p>You are the most patient and understanding person I have ever met. You listened to me and taught me how to communicate my feelings. You made me feel safe.</p>
                    <p>That is why I will always make it a priority to make things right with you. To communicate and resolve conflicts instead of running away from them, because I know you are one of a kind.</p>
                    <p>I'm sorry if I did something to upset you. Let's work it out. I love you.</p>

                    <h3>For when you feel trapped:</h3>
                    <p>This month, I saw you blossom. You gained so much confidence and took control of your own life. You are one of the bravest people I have ever met, and I don't think a lot of people would be able to survive the environment you were in.</p>
                    <p>You can always do what you want, whenever you want. You have a lot of power in you that you might not see, but when it comes out it is beautiful.</p>
                    <p>I hope you continue to find yourself, be yourself, and be 100% honest with yourself. You tend to be really harsh on yourself, but I think you should give yourself credit for continuously trying to be better everyday.</p>

                    <p>It is always fine to remind someone, cut them off, and most importantly: say no and standing up for yourself. You deserve to be heard, and have action taken from what you say. I hope that I make you feel heard in every conversation we have.</p>
